                <h1>Astrophysicist Professor -- Equation For Time Travel</h1>
                <br>
                <p style="padding: 0px 20px;">The idea of time travel has fascinated people for a long time
                    now. Numerous books and films have been written or directed
                    around this idea. According to Earth.com, one such book
                    named The Time Machine written by HG Wells sparked interest
                    about time travel in the mind of an astrophysicist professor
                    named Ron Mallet. He embarked on a seemingly unbelievable
                    quest to achieve this objective. Now, he finally claims to
                    have made an equation for the same. Professor Mallett’s
                    fascination with time travel and its equation has its
                    origins in a traumatising childhood experience. When the
                    Professor was just ten years old, his father, a television
                    repairman who fostered his son’s love of science, tragically
                    passed away from a heart attack. A young Mallett was
                    devastated to the core and sought solace in books.</p>
