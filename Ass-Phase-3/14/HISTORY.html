        </center>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Archaeology is the study of human activity in the past, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the
             material culture and environmental data that they have left behind, which includes artifacts,
             architecture, biofacts (also known as eco-facts) and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record).
             <br>
             <br>
             The development of the field of archaeology has its roots with history and with those who were interested
             in the past, such as kings and queens who wanted to show past glories of their respective nations. In the
             6th century BCE, Nabonidus of the Neo-Babylonian Empire excavated, surveyed and restored sites built more
             than a millennium earlier under Naram-sin of Akkad. The 5th-century-BCE Greek historian Herodotus was the
             first scholar to systematically study the past and also an early examiner of artifacts. In Medieval
             India, the study of the past was recorded. In the Song Empire (960–1279) of imperial China, Chinese
             scholar-officials unearthed, studied, and cataloged ancient artifacts, a native practice that continued
             into the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) before adoption of Western methods. The 15th and 16th centuries saw the
             rise of antiquarians in Renaissance Europe such as Flavio Biondo who were interested in the collection of
             artifacts. The antiquarian movement shifted into nationalism as personal collections turned into national
             museums. It evolved into a much more systematic discipline in the late 19th century and became a widely
             used tool for historical and anthropological research in the 20th century. During this time there were
             also significant advances in the technology used in the field.
             <br>
             <br>
             The OED first cites "archaeologist" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch
             of antiquarian activity. "Archaeology", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call "ancient
             history" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.

        <p>Khaemweset, a son of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses II, was known for his keen interest in identifying
             and restoring monuments of Egypt's past, such as Djoser's step pyramid. This pyramid, having been built
             in the 27th century BCE, predated Khaemweset by approximately 1,400 years. Due to his activities, he is
             sometimes nicknamed "the first Egyptologist".
             <br>
             <br>
             In ancient Mesopotamia, a foundation deposit of the Akkadian Empire ruler Naram-Sin (ruled c. 2200 BCE)
             was discovered and analysed by king Nabonidus of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, c. 550 BCE, who is thus known
             as the first archaeologist. Not only did he lead the first excavations which were to find the
             foundation deposits of the temples of Šamaš the sun god, the warrior goddess Anunitu (both located in
             Sippar), and the sanctuary that Naram-Sin built to the moon god, located in Harran, but he also had them
             restored to their former glory. He was also the first to date an archaeological artifact in his
             attempt to date Naram-Sin's temple during his search for it. Even though his estimate was inaccurate
             by about 1,500 years, it was still a very good one considering the lack of accurate dating
             technology.
             <br>
             <br>
             Early systemic investigation and historiography can be traced back to the Greek historian Herodotus
             (c. 484 – c. 425 BCE). He was the first western scholar to systematically collect artifacts and test
             their accuracy. He was also the first to make a compelling narrative of the past. He is known for a set
             of nine books called the Histories, in which he wrote everything he could learn about different regions.
             He discussed the causes and consequences of the Greco-Persian Wars. He also explored the Nile and Delphi.
             However, scholars have found errors in his records and believe he probably did not go as far up the
             Nile as he claimed.

        <p>Among the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation were Stonehenge and other megalithic monuments
             in England. The first known excavations made at Stonehenge were conducted by William Harvey and Gilbert
             North in the early 17th century. Both Inigo Jones and the Duke of Buckingham also dug there shortly
             afterwards. John Aubrey was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous megalithic and other field
             monuments in southern England. He also mapped the Avebury henge monument. He wrote Monumenta Britannica
             in the late 17th century as a survey of early urban and military sites, including Roman towns, "camps"
             (hillforts), and castles, and a review of archaeological remains, including sepulchral monuments, roads,
             coins and urns. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the
             chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield shapes.
             <br>
             <br>
             William Stukeley was another antiquarian who contributed to the early development of archaeology in the
             early 18th century. He also investigated the prehistoric monuments of Stonehenge and Avebury, work for
             which he has been remembered as "probably... the most important of the early forerunners of the
             discipline of archaeology". He was one of the first to attempt to date the megaliths, arguing that
             they were a remnant of the pre-Roman druidic religion.

        </div>
        <p>Excavations were carried out in the ancient towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, both of which had been
             covered by ashes during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the year 79. These excavations began in 1748 in
             Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738 under the auspices of King Charles VII of Naples. In
             Herculaneum, the Theatre, the Basilica and the Villa of the Papyri were discovered in 1768. The discovery
             of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of ancient frescos,
             had much impact throughout Europe.
             <br>
             <br>
             A very influential figure in the development of the theoretical and systematic study of the past through
             its physical remains was "the prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology," Johann Joachim
             Winckelmann. Winckelmann was a founder of scientific archaeology by first applying empirical
             categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the classical (Greek and Roman) history of art and
             architecture. His original approach was based on detailed empirical examinations of artefacts from which
             reasoned conclusions could be drawn and theories developed about ancient societies.
             <br>
             <br>
             In America, Thomas Jefferson, possibly inspired by his experiences in Europe, supervised the systematic
             excavation of a Native American burial mound on his land in Virginia in 1784. Although Jefferson's
             investigative methods were ahead of his time, they were primitive by today's standards.
