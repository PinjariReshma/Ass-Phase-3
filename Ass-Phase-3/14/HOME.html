        <p>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is an Indian government
            agency that is responsible for archaeological research and the
            conservation and preservation of cultural historical monuments in
            the country. It was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham during
            the British Raj who also became its first Director-General.</p>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>ASI was founded in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham who also became its
            first Director-General. The first systematic research into the
            subcontinent's history was conducted by the Asiatic Society, which
            was founded by the British Indologist Sir William Jones on 15
            January 1784. Based in Calcutta, the society promoted the study of
            ancient Persian texts and published an annual journal titled Asiatic
            Researches. Notable among its early members was Charles Wilkins who
            published the first English translation of the Bhagavad Gita in 1785
            with the patronage of the then Governor-General of Bengal, Warren
            Hastings. However, the most important of the society's achievements
            was the decipherment of the Brahmi script by James Prinsep in 1837.
            This successful decipherment inaugurated the asset.</p>
        <h3>Formation of the ASI</h3>
        <p>Armed with the knowledge of Brahmi, Alexander Cunningham, a protégé
            of James Prinsep, carried out a detailed survey of the Buddhist
            monuments of his own type to be constructed in the Nepalese tarai
            which lasted for over half a century. Inspired by early amateur
            archaeologists like the Italian military officer, Jean-Baptiste
            Ventura, Cunningham excavated stupas along the width, the length and
            breadth of India. While Cunningham funded many of his early
            excavations himself, in the long run, he realised the need for a
            permanent body to oversee archaeological excavations and the
            conservation of Indian monuments and used his stature and influence
            in India to lobby for an archaeological survey. While his attempt in
            1848 did not meet with success, the Archaeological Survey of India
            was eventually formed in 1861 by a statute passed into law by Lord
            Canning with Cunningham as the first Archaeological Surveyor. The
            survey was suspended briefly between 1865 and 1871 due to lack of
            funds but restored by Lord Lawrence the then Viceroy of India. In
            1871, the Survey was revived as a separate department and Cunningham
            was appointed as its first Director-General.</p>
        <p>Cunningham retired in 1885 and was succeeded as Director General by
            James Burgess. Burgess launched a yearly journal The Indian
            Antiquary (1872) and an annual epigraphical publication Epigraphia
            Indica (1882) as a supplement to the Indian Antiquary. The post of
            Director General was permanently suspended in 1889 due to a funds
            crunch and was not restored until 1902. In the interim period,
            conservation work in the different circles was carried out by the
            superintendents of the individual circles.

        <p>From 1888 started severe lobbying aimed at reducing Government
            expenses, and at curtailing the budget of the Archaeological Survey
            of India, a period of about ten years known as the "Buck crisis",
            after the Liberal Edward Buck.[3] In effect, this severely
            threatened the employment of the employees of the ASI, such as Alois
            Anton Führer, who had just started a family and become a father.[3]

            In 1892, Edward Buck announced that the Archaeological Survey of
            India would be shut down and all ASI staff would be dismissed by
            1895, in order to generate savings for the Government's
            budget.[3][4] It was understood that only a fantastic archaeological
            discovery within the next three years for example might be able to
            turn public opinion and save the funding of the ASI.[3]</p>
