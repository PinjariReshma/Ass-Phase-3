                              <p>'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is one of
                                   the most celebrated novels in literary
                                   history. Written by Lewis Carroll and
                                   published in 1865, the story is of a young
                                   girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit
                                   hole into a fantasy world populated by a
                                   collection of truly bizarre characters. Much
                                   debate surrounds the meaning behind the
                                   novel, and the themes underpinning the
                                   narrative. Essentially, Carroll describes how
                                   a child sees our adult world, but it's quite
                                   often a dark place with disturbing overtones.

                                   So, what exactly is he writing about, and why
                                   does this Victorian masterpiece contain so

                                   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly
                                   Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 English
                                   children's novel by Lewis Carroll, a
                                   mathematics don at Oxford University. It
                                   details the story of a young girl named Alice
                                   who falls through a rabbit hole into a
                                   fantasy world of anthropomorphic creatures.
                                   It is seen as an example of the literary
                                   nonsense genre. The artist John Tenniel
                                   provided 42 wood-engraved illustrations for
                                   the book.

                                   It received positive reviews upon release and
                                   is now one of the best-known works of
                                   Victorian literature; its narrative,
                                   structure, characters and imagery have had a
                                   widespread influence on popular culture and
                                   literature, especially in the fantasy
                                   genre.[1][2] It is credited as helping end an
                                   era of didacticism in children's literature,
                                   inaugurating an era in which writing for
                                   children aimed to "delight or entertain".[3]
                                   The tale plays with logic, giving the story
                                   lasting popularity with adults as well as
                                   with children.[4] The titular character Alice
                                   shares her name with Alice Liddell, a girl
                                   Carroll knew—scholars disagree about the
                                   extent to which the character was based upon
                                   her.[5][6]

                                   The book has never been out of print and has
                                   been translated into 174 languages. Its
                                   legacy covers adaptations for screen, radio,
                                   art, ballet, opera, musicals, theme parks,
                                   board games and video games.[7] Carroll
                                   published a sequel in 1871 entitled Through
                                   the Looking-Glass and a shortened version for
                                   young children, The Nursery "Alice", in 1890.
                                   Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was inspired
                                   on 4 July 1862, when Lewis Carroll and
                                   Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed up the
                                   river Isis with the three young daughters of
                                   Carroll's friend Henry Liddell:[8][9] Lorina
                                   Charlotte (aged 13; "Prima" in the book's
                                   prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance (aged 10;
                                   "Secunda" in the verse); and Edith Mary (aged
                                   8; "Tertia" in the verse).[10]

                                   The journey began at Folly Bridge, Oxford,
                                   and ended 5 miles (8 km) upstream at Godstow,
                                   Oxfordshire. During the trip Carroll told the
                                   girls a story that he described in his diary
                                   as "Alice's Adventures Under Ground" and
                                   which his journal says he
                                   "undertook to write out for Alice".[11] Alice
                                   Liddell recalled that she asked Carroll to
                                   write it down: unlike other stories he had
                                   told her, this one she wanted to
                                   preserve.[12] She finally received the
                                   manuscript more than two years later.[13]

                                   4 July was known as the "golden afternoon",
                                   prefaced in the novel as a poem.[14] In fact,
                                   the weather around Oxford on 4 July was
                                   "cool and rather wet", although at least one
                                   scholar has disputed this claim.[15] Scholars
                                   debate whether Carroll in fact came up with
                                   Alice during the "golden afternoon" or
                                   whether the story was developed over a longer
                                   period.[14]

                                   Carroll had known the Liddell children since
                                   around March 1856, when he befriended Harry
                                   Liddell.[16] He had met Lorina by early March
                                   as well.[17] In June 1856, he took the
                                   children out on the river.[18] Robert
                                   Douglas-Fairhurst, who wrote a literary
                                   biography of Carroll, suggests that Carroll
                                   favoured Alice Pleasance Liddell in
                                   particular because her name was ripe for
                                   allusion.[19] "Pleasance" means pleasure and
                                   the name "Alice" appeared in contemporary
                                   works including the poem "Alice Gray" by
                                   William Mee, of which Carroll wrote a parody;
                                   and Alice is a character in
                                   "Dream-Children: A Reverie", a prose piece by
                                   Charles Lamb.[19] Carroll, an amateur
                                   photographer by the late 1850s,[20] produced
                                   many photographic portraits of the Liddell
                                   children—but none more than Alice, of whom 20
                                   survive.[21] Carroll began writing the
                                   manuscript of the story the next day,
                                   although that earliest version is lost. The
                                   girls and Carroll took another boat trip a
                                   month later, when he elaborated the plot of
                                   the story to Alice, and in November he began
                                   working on the manuscript in earnest.[22] To
                                   add the finishing touches he researched
                                   natural history in connection with the
                                   animals presented in the book, and then had
                                   the book examined by other
                                   children—particularly those of George
                                   MacDonald. Though Carroll did add his own
                                   illustrations to the original copy, on
                                   publication he was advised to find a
                                   professional illustrator so that the pictures
                                   were more appealing to its audience. He
                                   subsequently approached John Tenniel to
                                   reinterpret Carroll's visions through his own
                                   artistic eye, telling him that the story had
                                   been well liked by the children.[22]

                                   Carroll began planning a print edition of the
                                   Alice story in 1863.[23] He wrote on 9 May
                                   1863 that MacDonald's family had suggested he
                                   publish Alice.[13] A diary entry for 2 July
                                   says that he received a specimen page of the
                                   print edition around that date.[23] On 26
                                   November 1864, Carroll gave Alice the
                                   manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under
                                   Ground, with illustrations by Carroll,
                                   dedicating it as
                                   "A Christmas Gift to a Dear Child in Memory of a Summer's Day".[24][25]
                                   The published version of Alice's Adventures
                                   in Wonderland is about twice the length of
                                   Alice's Adventures Under Ground and includes
                                   episodes, such as the Mad Hatter's Tea-Party
                                   (or Mad Tea Party), that did not appear in
                                   the manuscript.[26][23] The only known
                                   manuscript copy of Under Ground is held in
                                   the British Library.[23] Macmillan published
                                   a facsimile of the manuscript in
                                   1886.[23]</p>
